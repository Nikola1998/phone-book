# phone-book
JetBrains Academy project - it is a simulation of contact library like ones we have on our phones. I've learned essential basics of object-oriented programming (encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism), regex and more. The link to the task is here: https://hyperskill.org/projects/43?track=17

The project is quite self explaining, it's easy to try out, check it out!
